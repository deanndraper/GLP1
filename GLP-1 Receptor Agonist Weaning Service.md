## About Our Service

Our GLP-1 receptor agonist weaning service helps individuals safely and effectively stop taking their weight loss medication while maintaining the same reduced weight and food intake. We use a combination of psychology techniques to condition healthy behaviors and thought patterns as you gradually reduce and monitor your dosage.

 

## How It Works

1. **Initial Consultation**  
   Assess your current medication usage and weight loss goals.

2. **Personalized Plan**  
   Develop a personalized weaning plan with our experts. Begin recording your food intake, calories, and other relevant data.

3. **Therapy Sessions**  
   Regular sessions to condition healthy behaviors and thought patterns prior to weaning.

4. **Gradual Reduction**  
   Reduce GLP-1 receptor agonist dosage under medical supervision. Retain behaviors and thought patterns engrained during therapy sessions.

5. **Ongoing Support**  
   Maintain weight loss and healthy habits post-weaning.
