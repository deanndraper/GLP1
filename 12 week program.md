Excellent focus! Your program’s core logic hinges on leveraging the **GLP-1-induced eating patterns** as a “training window” to engrain lifelong habits. Clients learn to mimic the medication’s appetite-suppressing effects *behaviorally* before tapering doses. Here’s a revised, streamlined program framework centered on **habit entrenchment**, **identity rewiring**, and **dose-independent consistency**:

---

### **Program Name**: *"Sustain: Habit First, Medication Last"*  
**Structure**: *3 phases (8-12 weeks, customizable)*  

---

### **Phase 1: Habit Imprinting (Weeks 1-4)**  
**Goal**: Harness the medication’s appetite suppression to lock in small-portions, low-craving eating patterns as automatic habits.  

#### **Key Actions**:  
1. **Baseline Tracking (AI + Psychology)**:  
   - Clients log meals, hunger/fullness cues, and cravings via an AI app.  
   - AI identifies their "GLP-1-induced normal" (e.g., eating 1,500 calories daily without effort).  
2. **Hypnotherapy for Habit Imprinting**:  
   - **Session 1**: "Anchoring Your New Normal" (reinforce satisfaction with smaller portions).  
   - **Session 2**: "Embracing Effortless Consistency" (associate meal routines with pride, not restriction).  
3. **Micro-Habit Building**:  
   - Use the *"Minimum Viable Action"* strategy:  
     - Eat 80% of current portions 2x/week → 4x/week.  
     - Practice stopping at 70% fullness (track with AI app).  
4. **Psychological Reframing (CBT)**:  
   - Replace “I’m only doing this because of the shot” with “This is who I am now.”

### **Phase 2: Dose Reduction + Habit Fortification (Weeks 5-8)**  
**Goal**: Gradually reduce medication dosage *while* habit strength increases.  

#### **Key Actions**:  
1. **Medical Coordination**:  
   - Partner with prescribers to create a personalized tapering schedule (e.g., 0.5mg → 0.25mg Ozempic).  
2. **Hypnotherapy for Hormonal Cues**:  
   - **Session 3**: "Your Body Knows Fullness" (hypnotic suggestions to amplify natural satiety signals).  
   - **Session 4**: "Craving Immunity" (visualize cravings as passing clouds).  
3. **Habit "Overlearning"**:  
   - Use **habit stacking** to ritualize routines:  
     - After finishing a meal → drink herbal tea.  
     - Before bed → prep next day’s protein-rich breakfast.  
4. **AI-Powered Safeguards**:  
   - App detects *small deviations* (e.g., 10% calorie increase) and triggers:  
     - Automated hypnosis audio for cravings.  
     - Push notification: “This is just your old habits talking. Reset now with a 5-minute walk.”

### **Phase 3: Medication-Free Maintenance (Weeks 9-12+)**  
**Goal**: Maintain the GLP-1 eating patterns *without* medication using subconscious automation.  

#### **Key Actions**:  
1. **Hypnotherapy "Identity Rewrite"**:  
   - **Session 5**: “I Am Someone Who Eats Less, Naturally.”  
   - **Session 6**: “My Body Thrives on Consistency.”  
2. **AI-Driven Relapse Prevention**:  
   - Predictive analytics flag high-risk periods (e.g., seasonal stressors, vacations) and auto-schedule booster sessions.  
3. **Psychological Resilience (ACT*)**:  
   - Teach **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy** strategies:  
     - “Hunger is temporary; your habits are permanent.”  
     - Values-based eating (e.g., “I eat this way to play with my kids pain-free”).  
4. **Community Reinforcement**:  
   - Private client forum for accountability (e.g., “Post your meal pics!”).  

---

### **Critical Program Components**  
1. **Dose-Habit Sync**:  
   - Only reduce dosage *after* clients prove adherence to habits:  
     - Example: If they consistently eat 1,600 calories/day for 3 weeks → approve 25% dose reduction.  
2. **Hypnotherapy Focus**:  
   - Make habits *subconscious*. Example scripts:  
     - “You’ll feel *relief* skipping second helpings.”  
     - “Your hand automatically reaches for water, not snacks.”  
3. **AI Integration**:  
   - **Hunger-Satiety Algorithm**: Clients rate hunger 1-10 in the app → AI maps it to metabolic data (e.g., “Your body needs protein, not carbs, right now”).  
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Scans journal entries for emotional triggers and alerts therapists.  

---

### **Why This Works**  
- **Science-Backed**: GLP-1s create a unique window for habit formation by reducing cravings. Your program “transfers” the medication’s work to the client’s *behavior*.  
- **Dose Decoupling**: Clients stabilize habits *while still on medication*, making transitions smoother.  
- **Identity Shift**: Hypnotherapy moves clients from “I need Ozempic” to “I’m someone who doesn’t overeat.”  

---

### **How to Validate Success**  
1. **AI-Adherence Score**: Track consistency in pre-logged habits (e.g., meal timing, portion sizes).  
2. **Biomarkers**: Partner with labs to monitor blood sugar stability post-medication.  
3. **3-Month Follow-Up**: 90% of clients maintain weight within 5lbs of target.  

---

### **Risk Mitigation**  
- **Medical Oversight**: Require clients to taper doses under a prescriber’s supervision.  
- **Fallback Plans**: If habits slip, pause tapering and reintroduce hypnotherapy/CBT.

This program turns GLP-1 medications into a *temporary scaffold* while building a habit system designed to last a lifetime. The emphasis on **automation** (via hypnosis and AI) ensures clients don’t need willpower to maintain results.
