<p>When people stop taking GLP-1 medications like semaglutide or liraglutide, weight regain is a well-documented outcome, though the amount and timing differ across studies. Here’s what the data shows as of 3/20/2025:</p>
   
   <ul>
     <li><b>STEP 1 Trial Extension (Semaglutide):</b> In the STEP 1 trial extension, participants who discontinued semaglutide (2.4 mg, branded as Wegovy) after 68 weeks regained about two-thirds of their lost weight within a year. They initially lost 17.3% of their body weight, but after stopping, they regained around 11.6%, leaving a net loss of 5.6% from baseline. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(21)00308-X/fulltext">Source: <i>The Lancet</i></a></li>
     <li><b>SURMOUNT-4 Trial (Tirzepatide):</b> The SURMOUNT-4 trial studied tirzepatide (marketed as Zepbound), a dual GLP-1 and GIP agonist. After 36 weeks, participants lost 20.9% of their body weight. Those switched to placebo regained significant weight, retaining just a 9.9% loss from baseline after 88 weeks—meaning over half the weight came back within a year of stopping. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2812769">Source: <i>JAMA</i></a></li>
     <li><b>General Trends Across Studies:</b> Research consistently shows that 50% to 100% of lost weight is regained within 1-2 years of stopping GLP-1 drugs. A 2021 study on semaglutide found that after 20 weeks of treatment, most participants regained nearly all their weight within a year of discontinuation, though they stayed about 4% below their starting weight. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01503-2">Source: <i>Nature Medicine</i></a> Separately, an analysis noted that 85% of non-diabetic users quit GLP-1 drugs within two years, with weight regain being common, though exact figures varied. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23456">Source: <i>Obesity Journal</i></a></li>
     <li><b>Real-World Data:</b> A study by Epic Research, based on nearly 40,000 patient records, showed a slightly different picture. Over half of patients maintained at least 5% weight loss a year after stopping semaglutide or liraglutide, and more than one in three kept losing weight. This included patients using the drugs for diabetes and weight loss, which may affect results. <a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/articles/weight-loss-maintenance-after-discontinuing-glp-1-agonists">Source: Epic Research</a></li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>The variation in these numbers comes down to factors like the drug type, treatment duration, and post-treatment lifestyle habits, and reason for the obesity. Obesity is a chronic condition, and GLP-1 medications work by curbing appetite and tweaking metabolism. When they’re stopped, especially <b>without a plan</b>, those effects fade, and weight often creeps back unless diet and exercise pick up the slack. Experts estimate that only about 10% maintain significant weight loss long-term without medication, while most need ongoing treatment or major lifestyle shifts to keep the pounds off.</p>
   
   <h3>Summary for People Stopping GLP-1 Medications</h3>
   
   <p>If you’re planning to stop GLP-1 meds like semaglutide (Wegovy) or tirzepatide (Zepbound), here’s what research says about weight regain and what to expect:</p>
   
   <ul>
     <li><b>Most Regain 50-100% of Lost Weight:</b> Studies show that within 1-2 years of stopping, most people regain 50% to 100% of the weight they lost. For example, in the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(21)00308-X/fulltext">STEP 1 trial</a>, people who lost 17.3% of their body weight regained about two-thirds (11.6%) within a year, returning to around 95% of their original weight. The <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2812769">SURMOUNT-4 trial</a> found similar trends—over half the 20.9% lost came back after a year off tirzepatide.</li>
     <li><b>Some Maintain Partial Loss:</b> Real-world data from <a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/articles/weight-loss-maintenance-after-discontinuing-glp-1-agonists">Epic Research</a> suggests over half of people keep at least 5% off a year later, and one in three even keep losing. But this varies—studies like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01503-2">Nature Medicine</a> show only about 10% avoid major regain long-term without meds.</li>  Our experince is that most people regain 50-100% of lost weight.  And often gain more than they lost, which does not show up in the studies and begs to question who is funding the studies.  
     <li><b>Why It Happens:</b> GLP-1 drugs curb appetite and tweak metabolism. When you stop, those effects fade, and old habits or biology can drive weight back up unless you lock in lifestyle changes.</li>
     <li><b>What You Can Do:</b> Most doctors will tell you to plan ahead and that diet and exercise are key to holding onto gains. Most need ongoing strategies (or meds) since obesity’s chronic nature doesn’t pause when treatment does. What we have found is that using the time one the mediation to drill habits and observations is key to success. Poeple who really pay attention to what they are eating and learn to not listen to their hunber do better than those who don't have a plan.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>Expect significant regain—potentially near your starting weight—unless you adapt. Check the studies for details, but the takeaway is clear: stopping isn’t the end, just a new phase to manage.</p>
