# GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Weaning Service

## About Our Service

Our GLP-1 receptor agonist weaning service helps individuals safely and effectively stop taking their weight loss medication while maintaining the same reduced weight and food intake. We use a combination of psychology techniques to condition healthy behaviors and thought patterns as you gradually reduce and monitor your dosage.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Consultation**: Assess your current medication usage and weight loss goals.
2. **Personalized Plan**: Develop a personalized weaning plan with our experts.  Begin recording your food intake, calories, and other relevant data.
3. **Therapy Sessions**: Regular sessions to condition healthy behaviors and thought patterns prior to weaning.
4. **Gradual Reduction**: Reduce GLP-1 receptor agonist dosage under medical supervision.  Retain behaviors and thought patterns engrained during therapy sessions.
5. **Ongoing Support**: Maintain weight loss and healthy habits post-weaning.
