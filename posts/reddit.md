 **Title:** Seeking 5 Volunteers for GLP-1 Weaning Program - Testimonials Needed (BeyondWeightMeds.com) - **FREE, No Upsell**

**Body:**

Hi r/Semaglutide community,

I'm looking for 5 individuals who are actively considering or planning to wean off their GLP-1 medications (like semaglutide) to participate in our GLP-1 weaning program at BeyondWeightMeds.com.

**This is a completely FREE program. There is no upsell, no hidden fees, and this is not a marketing trick.** Our sole purpose is to gather testimonials and refine our weaning methodology through real-world feedback. I am doing this because I've seen firsthand the challenge of maintaining weight loss after stopping GLP-1 medications. Everyone I know, including myself, regained too much weight. As a hypnotherapist, I've observed that people often unconsciously revert to old eating habits, and surprisingly, quickly forget their previous eating patterns as if experiencing a form of state-dependent memory. I am looking for people who are serious about stopping the medication and willing to do it over a multi week period and who are currently on a full dossage. 

**Important:** Participants must already be under the supervision of a physician I can coordinate with. I are not providing medical advice, but rather a structured program to support the weaning process in conjunction with their existing medical care.

**What I'm looking for:**

* Individuals currently on GLP-1 medications who want to stop.
* Individuals willing to share their honest experiences and provide testimonialson our website and on google reviews etc. 
* Individuals who are actively working with a physician we can coordinate with.
* Individuals that are located in areas that allow for telehealth medical assistance.
* Individuals willing to do a video interview before and after the program.
* Individuals willing to track grocery shopping and eating out and share the data in Notion or something similar. 
* Individuals willing to take pictures of meals and grocery carts with their groceries when they checkout.
* Individuals that if located in Maryland are interested in optional hypnotherapy via Zoom.
* Individuls willing to track grocery shopping and eating out.
* Individuls that already use a budget tracking app with budgets for restaurants and groceries.  
* Individuls motivated to keep the weight off but willing to accept some weight gain.  
* Individuls willing to share ideas about how the program can be improved as well as complete periodic online quetionares.  
* Indivduals who lost between 20 and 50 lbs and are ok keeping most of it off.  
* It *would be nice* if you regained the weight and then had to go on the glp1 again to lose it since that would be clear proof of the programs effectiveness.  

**What the program includes:**

* A structured, guided weaning plan.
* Behavioral and psychological support.
* A methodogly for habit building while taking meds.  
* Coordination with your existing physician. 
* Optional hypnotherapy via Zoom (Maryland residents only).

**What I am NOT including:**

* Medical advice or prescriptions.
* Replacement of your existing medical care.
* Any financial obligations or product sales.

If you're interested in volunteering and sharing your journey, please comment below or send me a direct message. We will select 5 people based on the above criteria. We are looking for people who are serious about stopping the medication and are wanting to document their journey to refine our process.

Thank you for your interest!




Hello r/Semaglutide moderators and community,

I'm developing a program to support individuals who are weaning off GLP-1 medications like semaglutide, focusing on behavioral and psychological strategies to maintain weight loss. I'm looking to gather testimonials and refine the program through a small group of volunteers.  

Before posting a detailed request, I wanted to ask for permission to see if it would be acceptable to look for volunteers within this community. This is a research and refinement effort, and there is no cost or product being sold.  I would need between 5 and 10 people who want to stop and are on full dossages.  

Thank you for your consideration."

I want to be clear, I'm not selling anything, I am looking for feeback and testimonials and proof of concept.  I need people who are very internet savy, open to share info,  and communate well,  since  much of the tracking is online using things like notion etc.  A reddit user seems perfect.   I could even use reddit and create a group for it, hmmm.  

If you say yes I'm open to sending you the request first as well before posting it.  Thanks, Dean
